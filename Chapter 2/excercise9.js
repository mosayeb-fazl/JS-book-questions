// (Physics: acceleration) Average acceleration is defined as the change of velocity 
// divided by the time taken to make the change, as shown in the following formula:
// a = v1- v0
//        t
// Write a program that prompts the user to enter the starting velocity v0 in meters/
// second, the ending velocity v1 in meters/second, and the time span t in seconds, 
// and displays the average acceleration. Here is a sample run:
let v1=prompt('Enter the V1')
let v2=prompt('Enter the V2')
let t=prompt('Enter the time in seconds')
let acceleration= ( v1 - v2 ) / t
alert('The average acceleration is '+ acceleration)
