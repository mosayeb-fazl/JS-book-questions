// (Science: wind-chill temperature) How cold is it outside? The temperature alone 
// is not enough to provide the answer. Other factors including wind speed, rela
// tive humidity, and sunshine play important roles in determining coldness outside. 
// In 2001, the National Weather Service (NWS) implemented the new wind-chill 
// temperature to measure the coldness using temperature and wind speed. The 
// formula is
// twc = 35.74 + 0.6215ta- 35.75v0.16 + 0.4275tav0.16
// where ta is the outside temperature measured in degrees Fahrenheit and v is the 
// speed measured in miles per hour. twc is the wind-chill temperature. The formula 
// cannot be used for wind speeds below 2 mph or temperatures below -58ºF or 
// above 41ºF.
// Write a program that prompts the user to enter a temperature between -58ºF and 
// 41ºF and a wind speed greater than or equal to 2 and displays the wind-chill tem
// perature. Use Math.pow(a, b) to compute v0.16. Here is a sample run:
let Fahrenheit=prompt('Enter the temperature in Fahrenheit between -58°F and 41°F:')
let speed=prompt('Enter the wind speed (>=2) in miles per hour:')
let wind= 35.74 + 0.6215 * Fahrenheit - 35.75 * speed**0.16 + 0.4275 * Fahrenheit * speed**0.16
alert('The wind chill index is ' + wind)
