//  (Algebra: solve quadratic equations) The two roots of a quadratic equation 
// ax2 + bx + c = 0 can be obtained using the following formula:
// r1 =-b + 2b2- 4ac
// 2a
// and r2 =-b- 2b2- 4ac
// 2a
// b2- 4ac is called the discriminant of the quadratic equation. If it is positive, the 
// equation has two real roots. If it is zero, the equation has one root. If it is negative, 
// the equation has no real roots.
// Write a program that prompts the user to enter values for a, b, and c and displays 
// the result based on the discriminant. If the discriminant is positive, display two 
// roots. If the discriminant is 0, display one root. Otherwise, display “The equation 
// has no real roots”.
// Note that you can use Math.pow(x, 0.5) to compute 2x. Here are some 
// sample runs.
// Enter a, b, c: 1.0
let a=prompt('Enter the value for A')
let b=prompt('Enter the value for B')
let c=prompt('Enter the value for C')
let quadratic= ( -b + Math.sqrt(b**2 - 4*a*c)) / 2*a
